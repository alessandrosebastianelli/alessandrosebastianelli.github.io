The School is organized by Universit√† degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro (UniBA), Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) and INFN Sezione di Bari, in synergy with the Quantum Workshops held every two years in Turin.

The Quantum 2024 Summer School is oriented to PhD students, Master students and young researchers, and aims to provide a privileged vision of quantum science and technologies, from quantum imaging and metrology to quantum communication, computing, and simulation, with both a theoretical and an experimental perspective.

The second edition of the Summer School is part of the Physics Department Excellence Project "Quantum Sensing and Modelin for One Health" (QUASIMODO), financed by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR), and of the PNRR-MUR project "National Quantum Science and Technology Institute" (NQSTI, PE_00000023).

The School is dedicated to prof. Franco Selleri, who has started the research on foundations of quantum mechanics in the Bari Physics Department.
