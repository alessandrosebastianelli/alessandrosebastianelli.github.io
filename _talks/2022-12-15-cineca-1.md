Fifth edition of the CINECA annual conference dedicated to the relationship between Quantum Computing and HPC. Finally back in presence!

Like every year, the HPCQC workshop aims to deepen the relationship between HPC and QC. This year, in particular, this relationship has become even closer: EuroHPC JU has selected 6 hosting entities to install the latest generation quantum computers to be integrated with as many highly advanced supercomputers.

CINECA competed and won by representing a consortium formed by Italy (leader), Germany and Slovenia: soon a quantum computer will be installed to make the Leonardo supercomputer even more technological and performing!

In this year's edition we will see how Italy and the various European countries are preparing to welcome these new machines that will be made available to European researchers. We will also see how quantum computer manufacturing companies have increased the power of their computers and we will meet new start-ups that appear in the current market landscape. Finally, a considerable space will be dedicated to the most interesting research presented so far.
