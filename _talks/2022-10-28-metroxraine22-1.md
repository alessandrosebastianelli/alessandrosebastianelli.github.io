The 2022 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for eXtended Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Engineering (IEEE MetroXRAINE 2022) will be an international event mainly aimed at creating a synergy between experts in eXtended Reality, Brain-Computer Interface, and Artificial Intelligence, with special attention to the measurement.

The conference will be a unique opportunity for discussion among scientists, technologists, and companies on very specific sectors in order to increase the visibility and the scientific impact for the participants. The organizing formula will be original owing to the emphasis on the interaction between the participants to exchange ideas and material useful for their research activities.

MetroXRAINE will be configured as a synergistic collection of sessions organized by the individual members of the Scientific Committee. Round tables will be held for different projects and hot research topics. Moreover, we will have demo sessions, students contests, interactive company expositions, awards, and so on.

**Papers presented by me during the conference:**
- M. P. Del Rosso, A. Sebastianelli, D. Spiller and S. L. Ullo, "A demo setup testing onboard CNNs for Volcanic Eruption  Detection", in IEEE Metrology for eXtended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering (MetroXRAINE)
- P. Di Stasio, A. Sebastianelli, G. Meoni and S. L. Ullo, "Early Detection of Volcanic Eruption through Artificial Intelligence on board", in IEEE Metrology for eXtended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering (MetroXRAINE)
