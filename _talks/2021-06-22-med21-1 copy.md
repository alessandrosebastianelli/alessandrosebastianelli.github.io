MED 2021 will focus on smart cities and smart systems and will include tutorials and workshops, a technical program of presentations, keynote lectures, and social events. It offers a great opportunity for academics, researchers, and industrial players working in control and automation to network together, present research progress, and addresses new challenges.

The conference will include a wide range of topics on systems, automation, robotics and control including theory, hardware, software, communication technologies and applications to smart grids, intelligent buildings, smart mobility, healthcare, factory 4.0, cyber-physical systems, and more.
