The "Introduction to Quantum Computing" school aims to provide students with the necessary skills to effectively use the emerging quantum machines that have become available in recent years. These machines are constantly evolving and require specialized knowledge to operate. Although their technology is not yet fully mature, it is strategically important for students to learn how to use them early on, as they are fundamentally different from traditional computers. The school covers the basics of quantum mechanics and linear algebra, and then delves into practical and theoretical aspects of popular quantum concepts and algorithms using various available quantum machines. Additionally, there will be hands-on sections using emulators installed on our High Performance Computing (HPC) machines to provide practical experience.
