The workshop aims to explore how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are enhancing Earth System Observation and Prediction (ESOP). These techniques are revolutionizing various fields like image recognition and weather forecasting. They're particularly useful for creating digital models of the Earth, improving weather and climate prediction accuracy, and advancing computing paradigms such as High-Performance Computing (HPC), edge computing, and quantum computing (QC). Researchers are also exploring mixed models that can process both text and images for applications like environmental monitoring and disaster management. The workshop will feature presentations and discussions on the fusion of ML/DL with traditional ESOP techniques, aiming to showcase impact, address challenges, and propose future directions over four days. It welcomes industry participation to demonstrate commercial applications and aims to produce a report summarizing key insights and recommendations from the discussions.
