The European Space Agency (ESA) is organising a Φ-week event, 9-13 September 2019, focusing on EO Open Science and FutureEO - to review the latest developments in Open Science trends.

Come and hear about the latest trends in EO! The Φ-week will include a variety of events (e.g. inspiring talks, workshops, roundtables, startup pitch, hackathons) to connect multi-disciplinary communities - from EO researchers, data scientists, non-space corporates, tech leaders, entrepreneurs, up to startup and innovators - to (i) explore together how EO Open Science and innovation can benefit from the latest digital technologies and (ii) help shapeFutureEO missions and services.

The event will help you to:

- Gain insight into the latest trends in EO Open Science New Space, and the impact of new technologies such as AI and blockchain on space and FutureEO,
- Connect and Network with the new ecosystem of space including scientists, innovators, corporate leaders, startups and investors,
