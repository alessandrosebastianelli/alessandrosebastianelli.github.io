The International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS). It is aimed at providing a platform for sharing knowledge and experience on recent developments and advancements in geoscience and remote sensing technologies, particularly in the context of earth observation, disaster monitoring and risk assessment.

On behalf of the IEEE GRSS and the IGARSS 2022 Organising Committee, we are pleased to invite you to the 42nd annual IGARSS symposium, which will be held in hybrid format. We welcome you to join us physically at KLCC or virtually via our online platform.
